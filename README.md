# DINGO

**DINGO** â€” *Dispersion-based INference for Galaxy Observations* â€” is a Python package designed to fit galaxy kinematics using **both R and C grism spectroscopy**.

It provides robust modeling of galaxy rotation curves, dynamical mass profiles, and kinematic fields through a joint-inference framework leveraging dual-grism data (R+C) from instruments like JWST/NIRCam.

- ðŸ”µ Joint modeling of R and C grism images.
- ðŸ”µ Arctangent disk rotation curve fitting.
- ðŸ”µ Velocity field generation.
- ðŸ”µ Dynamical mass profile estimation.
- ðŸ”µ Visualization tools for grism images, velocity fields, and residuals.
